# MemoryManagementAPI---Phase-1-
In this project, you are going to implement a memory heap management API, and we will provide a code for you to test your API. You are expected to create a shared memory, in order to manage memory requests coming from multiple threads and grant or decline requests based on free space available. You are also expected to manage all mutexes and semaphores for shared memory access.
